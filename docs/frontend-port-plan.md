Frontend Port Plan — Integration & Cleanup (Routegna)

Goal: The legacy Shuttle Management frontend has been copied into `packages/client`. We are now systematically fixing linting issues, rebranding from MMCY to Routegna, and integrating with our backend. The focus is on making the existing code work properly in our monorepo environment.

Guiding Principles
- Rebrand fully: replace all MMCY references (case variants) with Routegna; swap logos/assets and visible copy.
- Keep navigation simple: remove any legacy sidebar; use a top navigation bar.
- Align with backend: cookie-based session (`credentials: 'include'`), tenant-aware API calls, and RBAC.
- Keep Vite + pnpm workspace standards. Prefer `fetch` over ad-hoc axios unless already standardized.
- Make incremental, verifiable changes: page-by-page, service-by-service.

Current State Snapshot

Backend Alignment (APIs, Auth, Roles)
- API base: `/api` mounted in `app.ts`; Auth base: `/auth`.
- CORS: server enforces `CORS_ORIGINS` allowlist. For local dev, set `CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173` (or your Vite dev URL) on the server; client must send `credentials: 'include'`.
- Rate limiting: in-memory limiter returns 429 with `Retry-After`. Frontend should show a friendly message and optionally retry.
- Session: `/auth/sign-in` sets `session` httpOnly cookie; `/auth/me` reads it; `/auth/logout` clears it. Handle 401 by redirecting to `/login`; show ban info for 403 with `{ error: 'Account is banned', reason }`.
- Roles: Two styles appear in backend:
  - Uppercase (auth middleware): `ADMIN`, `MANAGER` (via `requireRoles`)
  - Lowercase (resource routes): `admin`, `administrator`, `fleetManager` (via `requireRole`)
  - Frontend should normalize user roles (e.g., map uppercase to lowercase) and gate UI for: `admin`, `administrator`, `fleetManager`, `user`.

API Surface (confirmed endpoints)
- Auth (`/auth`):
  - POST `/sign-in` and `/sign-in/email` → body `{ email, password }` → sets cookie; returns `{ user: { id, email, tenantId, role } }`
  - GET `/me` → returns user or 401
  - POST `/logout` → clears cookie
- Routes (`/api/routes`):
  - GET `/` → list non-deleted routes with `vehicle`, `shift`, and `stops.employee`
  - GET `/unique-locations` → routes with `uniqueLocations` derived from employee locations
  - GET `/:id` → a single route
  - GET `/shift/:shiftId` → routes for shift
  - GET `/:routeId/stops` → all stops for a route
  - POST `/` → create route. Important constraints enforced by server:
    - `totalTime` must be <= 90 minutes
    - `shuttleId` maps to `vehicleId`; vehicle must exist and have an assigned `driverId`
    - Each employee must be unassigned; stops must belong to those employees and not be assigned to any route
    - Transaction marks employees assigned, associates stops, upserts `VehicleAvailability`
- Shuttles/Vehicles (`/api/shuttles`):
  - GET `/` → active vehicles; GET `/deleted` → soft-deleted
  - GET `/:id` → single vehicle
  - POST `/` → create vehicle. Body mapping: `{ name, licensePlate -> plateNumber, categoryId, dailyRate, capacity, model?, type? ('in-house'|'outsourced'), vendor? }`
  - PUT `/:id` → partial update; same field mapping rules
  - DELETE `/:id` → soft-delete
  - PATCH `/:id/status` → `{ status: 'active'|'maintenance'|'inactive', lastMaintenance?, nextMaintenance? }`
  - POST `/:id/restore` → restore soft-deleted vehicle
- Search (`/api/search`):
  - GET with query params: `?query=...&limit=20&isRouteQuery=true&role=...` (or `forceRole` for debug)
  - Returns mixed results: `route`, `department`, `vehicle`, and for admin: `employee`; for admin/manager: `driver`; plus `shift` entries.
- Other mounted base paths (to integrate later): `/employees`, `/departments`, `/drivers`, `/shuttle-categories`, `/clusters`, `/notifications`, `/vehicle-requests`, `/shifts`.

Service Contracts (frontend adapters)
- `authClient`:
  - `signIn(email, password)` → POST `/auth/sign-in` with `credentials: 'include'`
  - `me()` → GET `/auth/me` → on 401 clear client session and redirect
  - `logout()` → POST `/auth/logout`
- `routeService`:
  - `list()` → GET `/api/routes`
  - `get(id)` → GET `/api/routes/${id}`
  - `listByShift(shiftId)` → GET `/api/routes/shift/${shiftId}`
  - `stops(routeId)` → GET `/api/routes/${routeId}/stops`
  - `uniqueLocations()` → GET `/api/routes/unique-locations`
  - `create(payload)` → POST `/api/routes` (client validation mirrors server constraints; map `vehicleId` → `shuttleId` when calling server)
- `vehicleService`:
  - `list()` → GET `/api/shuttles`
  - `get(id)` → GET `/api/shuttles/${id}`
  - `create(dto)` → POST `/api/shuttles` (map UI `licensePlate` to server `licensePlate` which becomes DB `plateNumber`)
  - `update(id, dto)` → PUT `/api/shuttles/${id}`
  - `remove(id)` → DELETE `/api/shuttles/${id}`
  - `updateStatus(id, body)` → PATCH `/api/shuttles/${id}/status`
  - `listDeleted()` and `restore(id)` for deleted items
- `searchService`:
  - `search(q, opts)` → GET `/api/search` with `query`, `limit`, `isRouteQuery`, optional `role`

RBAC & Tenant Rules (frontend behavior)
- Normalize roles from session to one canonical set: `{ admin, administrator, fleetManager, user }`.
- Gate routes and controls based on roles used in backend:
  - Routes read endpoints require one of: `admin`, `administrator`, `fleetManager`.
  - Vehicle create/update likely manager/admin (confirm per route when wiring pages).
- Tenant: server derives `tenantId` from session; no extra client header is required. Avoid cross-tenant navigation by construction. Keep a (future) tenant switcher if needed; all calls remain credentialed.

HTTP Semantics & Error Handling
- Always call `fetch` with `{ credentials: 'include' }`.
- Handle JSON validation errors (400) with `errors: []` shape for some endpoints (e.g., vehicles).
- Handle 401 (not authenticated) → redirect; 403 (forbidden/banned) → show message; 404 → toast; 429 → rate limit notice and retry suggestion.

Environment Matrix (client + server)
- Client:
  - `VITE_API_BASE` → usually same-origin; if cross-origin, ensure server `CORS_ORIGINS` includes the Vite origin.
  - `VITE_ENABLE_MSW` (optional)
  - `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` if map features are enabled
- Server:
  - `CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated), `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX`

Page-Specific Notes from Backend
- Routes creation must enforce:
  - totalTime <= 90 minutes; startTime derives from `shift.endTime`; endTime = start + totalTime
  - Vehicle must exist and have `driverId`
  - Employees must be unassigned and their stops unassigned
  - On success, employees become assigned; VehicleAvailability entry is upserted
- Vehicles (shuttles):
  - Model uses `plateNumber` internally; UI should still display/edit `licensePlate` and map it in service
  - Soft delete and restore supported; status lifecycle includes `maintenance`

Testing Additions (based on backend)
- Auth flow test: sign-in → `/auth/me` → protected API 200; logout → protected API 401.
- Role-gate tests: mock session role and ensure gated UI controls hidden/disabled.
- Routes creation client validation mirrors server constraints; unit test DTO mapping (`vehicleId`→`shuttleId`).
- Search integration test: assert mixed result types are rendered correctly.


Update Log — 2025-08-19
- Resolved remaining TypeScript compile issues (animated tabs typing, auth client export conflict, global test token typing).
- Verified ESLint clean for JS/JSX; build compiles TS/TSX without blocking errors.
- Backend auth routes confirmed: `/auth/sign-in`, `/auth/sign-in/email`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/logout` (port 3001). Client `authClient` uses `credentials: 'include'` and `API_BASE` default http://localhost:3001.
- Added debug logging in `AuthContext` login flow to surface server errors while validating credentials.
 - Rebranding progress: replaced logos in TopBar, Sidebar, Login, Home; updated texts in Footer, About, RouteList; map HQ label; loading animation text. Added `logo-dark.PNG` and `logo-light.png` assets.
 - Updated `packages/client/.env` to set `VITE_HQ_NAME="Routegna (HQ)"`.
 - Updated Shuttle Add dialog placeholder to "Routegna Express 3".

Update Log — 2025-08-20
- Implemented global 401 redirect with `next=` and added global 403 redirect to `/unauthorized` in all axios clients (`api.js`, settings `apiService.js`, and `clusterService.js`).
- Normalized roles in `RoleContext` to map uppercase backend roles to frontend canonical roles; hardened user dropdown role display and badge.
- Increased logo sizes across UI for better visibility (TopBar, Sidebar, Home, Login).

Update Log — 2025-08-20 (cont.)
- Standardized API base handling across clients: `api.js`, `clusterService.js`, `settings/apiService.js` now use `VITE_API_BASE` (fallback `VITE_API_URL`) and `/api` via dev proxy. All send `withCredentials`.
- Refactored `UserContext` to rely on `authClient.getSession()` (`/auth/me`), removed legacy `/api/auth/get-session` call and unsafe casts.
- Added manualChunks to Vite build for heavy libs (`mapbox-gl`, `recharts`, `chart.js`, `framer-motion`, React libs).
- Renamed package to `@routegna/client` per plan.
- Added `VITE_API_BASE` to `.env`.

Update Log — 2025-08-21
- Removed all recruitment/candidate/batch features from UI, services, notifications, and search.
- Refactored EmployeeManagement to employees-only with filters, sorting, pagination, and activate/deactivate.
- Simplified `EmployeeTable.jsx`; deleted dead candidate/batch code paths.
- Updated EmployeeManagement README to reflect the new scope.

Update Log — 2025-08-21 (cont.)
- Notifications: normalized client API to server shape; aligned icon types to `route|shuttle|vehicle|employee|department|driver`; removed legacy batch icon.
- Validators: renamed `validateCandidateData` → `validateEmployeeUploadData` and updated imports/usages in `DataTable.jsx` and `EmployeeUploadSection.jsx`.
 - Cleanup: removed obsolete `candidate` branch from TopBar `TypeIcon`; renamed local variables in `validateFileContents` from `candidate` → `employee` for clarity; identified legacy `notificationService.js` as unused (pending deletion after reference sweep).

Next Actions
- Rebranding: confirm no MMCY images remain in `public/assets`; final sweep with ripgrep excluding `dist`.
- Backend integration polish: ensure session persists across refresh; implement redirect-to-login on 401 globally.
- Warnings: address large chunk warning and `MapComponent.jsx` mixed static/dynamic imports; consider lazy loading and `manualChunks`.
- Testing: add a happy-path auth test exercising sign-in → `/auth/me` → logout, and basic protected route guard checks.
